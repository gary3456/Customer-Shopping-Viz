### Background Information

Understanding customer shopping patterns is crucial for making informed business and marketing decisions. We are social animals influenced by their surroundings. The shopping pattern of a customer is influenced by various factors such as demographics, preferences, and behavior. Analyzing customer shopping patterns can help businesses identify trends, preferences, and opportunities to improve their marketing strategies and customer service.

### Business Question

The business question is to analyze the shopping patterns of customers and identify key trends and insights that can help businesses improve their marketing strategies and customer service.

### Data Description

The dataset contains detailed transactional data across various product categories, customer demographics, and purchase channels. Key features may include:

    - Transaction Details: Purchase date, transaction value, product category, and payment method.
    - Customer Information: Age group, gender, location, and loyalty status.
    - Shopping Behavior: Frequency of purchases, average spend per transaction, and seasonal trends.

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- **Data Loading**: Import the dataset into Power BI using Python script.
- **Data Cleaning**: There is no missing data in the dataset. However, we need to convert the data types of some columns.
- **Data Formatting**: Format the data to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis.

### Data Analysis

The visualization is intended to provide an understanding of customer shopping patterns and business performance at two granularities: overviews and regional insights. It is designed to cater to different stakeholders, including business owners, who need a quick grasp of the status quo, marketing teams, and sales teams, who need detailed and actionable insights to make informed decisions.

Overviews provide a high-level summary of key metrics, while regional insights provide a detailed analysis of customer behavior by region. The regional insights enable a localized approach to marketing and sales strategies, taking into account regional preferences and trends based on the demographic.

The dashboard incorporates the temporal aspect of customer shopping patterns, such as seasonal trends and customer behavior over time. This allows businesses to zero in on specific time periods to identify patterns and trends that can help them optimize their marketing strategies and customer service.

The key metrics and visualizations are as follows:

KPIs:

- **Total Sales Amount**: The total amount of sales generated by the business.
- **Average Transaction Value Per Customer**: The average value of each transaction made by customers.
- **Total Number of Customers**: The total number of customers who made transactions.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: The overall satisfaction level of customers  

Constrainted by the scope of the dataset, this visualization attempts to provide a snapshot of customer shopping patterns and business performance. The insights derived from this visualization can serve as a starting point for further analysis and exploration of customer behavior and preferences as below:

1. What is the subscription rate of customers?
   - What customer demographics are most likely to subscribe?
   - What is the average spend of subscribed customers compared to non-subscribed customers?
   - What is the potential revenue increase from increasing the subscription rate?
2. What is the sales generated by the business? Where are the highest sales coming from?
    - What is the projected revenue based on current sales trends?
    - What is the market share of each region, deriving from the existing customer base?
    - How to position the business in the market to capture the opportunity?
3. What products are most popular among customers?
    - Are the customer more susceptible to purchasing certain products due to specific marketing strategies, like promotion? If so, on what platform?
4. Is there a relationship between shopping frequency and preferred shipping methods?
   - What are the factors driving the decision of customers to choose a specific shipping method?
   - From the current shipping method selection trend, what is the projected revenue increase from optimizing the shipping method?
